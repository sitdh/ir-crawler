The value of Ionic for web developers is that grants the flexibility of developing mobile applications for major mobile platforms without getting into the complexity of working with native frameworks and languages.Beginning Ionic Hybrid Application Development delivers your first steps into developing elegant, feature-rich cross-platform mobile applications with the framework, whilst taking advantage of its AngularJS backbone, and the Cordova API set.We start off installing Ionic, exploring various commands such as start, serve, platform, run, and emulate, giving you a basic foundation of working with the Ionic CLI. We will then walk through built-in templates, themes, and headers, before creating an Ionic list, rendering data for it, and taking a look at creating services to manage our data efficiently.Next, we start to incorporate greater sophistication by adding elements such as infinite scroll and pull-to-refresh, implementing data persistence, and focus on generally enhancing the user experience. Finally, we will talk about deploying our application to an emulator for testing purposes, and discuss Cordova plugins that can add even more functionality.

If it is the latter, then you should read on ... This comprehensive project-based course has been designed with following objectives:To help you get an in-depth understanding of both core   &amp; advanced concepts in JavaTo teach best practices   &amp; key design principles for writing effective Java programsTo help you gain practical   experience in writing professional-level code via instructor-led   implementation of a project. Project is implemented in Eclipse using MVC design pattern, TDD   (Test-Driven Development) principles and other best practicesTo help you understand   the inner workings of Java platform (aka JVM)To teach how to effectively use   Eclipse IDE to write, debug,   and test Java programsThe motivation behind these objectives is to help you in becoming a complete &amp; industry-ready engineer. Most Java courses focus only on teaching core fundamentals, which at the very best equip students with good basic skills to work on small-to-medium sized projects. Most of these students fall short when it comes to implementing more complex projects. To design elegant solutions for large, complex projects one needs to have a much deeper understanding of language features along with knowledge of the recommended best practices &amp; design principles. More importantly one needs to know how to put all of these into practice. This comprehensive one-stop project-based course has been designed to equip students with these skills. Course Specifics This course begins by giving a birds-eye view of Java covering everything from origin of Java to installing Java and writing your first Java program. Even the most fundamental concepts like compilation &amp; interpretation are explained. All other topics are covered in-depth starting from language basics, object-oriented concepts (including relevant Java 8 features), JVM, exceptions, IO, data structures, generics, multi-threading, nested classes, enums, and annotations. Each lecture has been very carefully crafted. Motivation behind every concept is clearly explained with well thought out examples and nice animations. Object-oriented concepts like inheritance &amp; polymorphism are explained through a real-world case-study, which is also implemented as part of the course project. Every concept has been well-tested through ready-to-run, downloadable demo programs, which are implemented and executed in the course. Every chapter ends with a carefully crafted quiz to test what was learnt. Few of the chapters also include challenging coding exercises and student solutions are also auto-evaluated via JUnit scripts. One of the coding exercises is on Sentiment Analysis, which is a hot area in the industry.The course project simulates a real-world product that is based on bookmarking concept. The project is instructor-led and is implemented using proper coding conventions &amp; best practices. The project incorporates MVC design pattern and uses Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. The entire project is implemented using the popular Eclipse IDE. There is also a separate dedicated chapter just for learning Eclipse IDE. It will give you a solid foundation in using Eclipse to effectively write, debug, and test Java programs. The chapter includes lessons to use Eclipse\'s debugger &amp; JUnit unit testing framework. Finally, the course also discusses several best practices/design rules outlined in the popular Effective Java book. This is one of the highlights of the course and will make you truly complete!About the Instructor &amp; On His Motivation for Building This CourseI have over 10\n years of experience in Java developing complex data integration &amp; \nmining software for start-ups in silicon valley and elsewhere. After \nworking for so many years with many excellent engineers, I realized that\n sometimes we fell short of developing the most effective solutions to \nsome of the problems we were dealing with. This sometimes led to several\n rounds of refactoring resulting in loss of valuable time. This made me \nrealize that it was a result of not being taught Java programming in the\n right way. I realized that a more holistic approach to teaching Java is\n needed where the language features are taught along with the best \npractices &amp; design principles that any serious developer must know. \nThis course is a result of this realization and it has taken me around 2 years of full-time effort\n (considered equivalent to a decade if working on a part-time basis) in \ndeveloping it. Building this course itself has been a wonderful journey \nfor me and I hope you will also find this course to be equally \nenriching. I will continue to devote myself in building this course \ntowards making it one of the best Java courses out there. Always, feel free to message me if you have any questions and I promise to address them as quickly as I can.','English','\n                36.5 hours\n            ',1410,257,4.50000,'https://www.udemy.com/java-in-depth-become-a-complete-java-engineer/','https://udemy-images.udemy.com/course/750x422/358540_d06b_6.jpg'),('d15defc98f1346a885de060352f8aaf6','Introduction to Java for Programmers','Course Description\n      \n      \n        \n           	Course Summary   	     With over 200 videos and 20 hours of content, this online Java training course is designed to provide a solid foundation in Java programming and Eclipse for programmers who are already proficient in another language.

It\'s simply due to the fact that the vast majority of people who try don\'t have a basic understanding of the technology they\'re going to use. How exactly can you tackle responsive design if you don\'t now how a browser works?How are you going to create a desktop application if you don\'t know what makes your computer freeze constantly (besides porn, obviously)?How are you going to hide your confused facial expression the next time your site\'s server crashes because of a \"node socket problem\" in your full stack Javascript?If you\'ve ever taken your computer to a technician and said \"Make it work\" or \"It don\'t work good.
